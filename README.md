**Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction** — An end-to-end ML system for proactive patient care.

---

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning system to predict 30-day readmission risk for diabetic inpatients. Risk scores are pre-computed nightly and made available at discharge, enabling care coordinators to prioritize follow-up for high-risk patients.

- **Dataset**: Diabetes 130-US Hospitals (UCI ML Repository, id 296) — Strack et al., 2014  
- **Target**: Binary classification — readmitted within 30 days (yes/no)  
- **Submission**: Group Project Checkpoint Proposal — 8 March 2026

## Key Findings (EDA)

- **101,766 encounters**, 71,518 unique patients — patient-level split required to avoid leakage  
- **11.2%** positive class (30-day readmission) — class imbalance  
- **weight** 96.9% missing — to be dropped  
- **HbA1c** 83.3% "not tested" — treat as informative category  
- **medical_specialty** 49.1%, **payer_code** 39.6% missing — treat as "Unknown" category  
- **5 near-zero-variance medications** — candidates for removal  

See `notebooks/EDA.md` for full details.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`  
3. Install dependencies (see `requirements.txt` when available)  
4. Run `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` for data exploration
